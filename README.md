# Weather-Dashboard

The goal of this challenge/project was to create a weather dashboard.

1. The point of this assignment was to create a weather dashboard that gives you the 
   temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index for any city.

2. On the left-hand side, you'll see the history of cities searched. You have the option of clearing the history.

3. There is a five day forecast feature that let's you see the weather in advanced so you can plan your trip accordingly!
